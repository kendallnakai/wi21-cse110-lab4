**What was the bug?**
The bug was that the numbers were concatonating instead of adding like normal integers. Num1 and Num2's value have a change of being considered strings


**How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix.**
I fixed it by having num1 and num2 subtract 0 which forces it to recognize the characters or strings as numbers on both ends which then made the result an integer adding as well
